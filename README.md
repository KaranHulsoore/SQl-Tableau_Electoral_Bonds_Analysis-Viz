Electoral Bonds were a mode of funding for political parties in India from their introduction in 2017 till they were struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on 15 February 2024.Following their termination, a five-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice directed the State Bank of India to hand over the identities and other details of donors and recipients to the Election Commission of India, which was in turn asked to publish them on its website. We used that data for analsyis by using PostgresSQL and tableau for data Viz.
